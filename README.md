# Task Manager App

This application is built with React. In this project, I’ve implemented key React concepts such as components, state, props, conditional rendering, and event handling. 

## Features

- **Add New Todos**: Users can add new items to the list using a form.
- **Complete Todos**: Mark items as completed to keep track of what’s done.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove items from the list that are no longer needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
